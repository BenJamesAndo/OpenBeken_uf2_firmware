# OpenBeken_uf2_firmware
BK7231T &amp; BK7231N .uf2 firmware for flashing from ESPHome to OpenBeken
Converted the firmware using [ltchiptool](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool) CLI. <br>
Providing them here for ease of access. Make sure you select the write firmware, as not doing so could brick your device. I've personally used the BK7231N .uf2 file and it worked great.
