# OpenBeken_uf2_firmware
BK7231T &amp; BK7231N .uf2 firmware for flashing from ESPHome to OpenBeken.
The firmware was converted using the firmware [ltchiptool](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool) CLI. <br>
Providing them here for ease of access. Make sure you select the right firmware, as not doing so could brick your device. I've personally used both .uf2 files and they've worked great. <p>
More info on how to convert can be found [here](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool/issues/7).

Once downloaded, navigate to your ESPHome device and upload the .uf2 file.

# Updating
Once you're running OpenBeken you can download the latest version via the web UI or from the official releases page at https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App/releases
